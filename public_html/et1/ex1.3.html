            I present you my Fix- it project: an SSD cover. 
            It may seem basic and simple, but it is in fact VERY practical. It all started when we had to buy an SSD to store all our different project through out the three years in this program. While searching, I realized that this item is worth at least 250$. Very expensive for a college student if you ask me. I noticed that it could easily get scratched or dented due to the metal case. So, thatâ€™s how I got the idea of making an SSD cover for this project.
            With the tools in Fusion 360, it was very simple to create. Mostly, just rectangles. The only challenging part was the measurements. For example, comparing the sizing on the app versus in real life required a lot of imagination. It was tricky, but I managed to make it work. During this project, my main worry was the grip between the metal case and the PLA filament. I was scared that it might just slide off and all my hard work would go to waste. For it to be aesthetically pleasing, I chose the colour white.

            I had to print this SSD cover three times. 
            On my first attempt, I over estimated how big the inside compartment should be to fit the SSD. 
            On my second print, we forgot to insert some supports on the frog design. In the end, the PLA filament was printing on air and created a mess.
            On my third and final try, we got it correctly!!
