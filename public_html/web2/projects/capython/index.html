     <h3>Challenges</h3>
     <p>
        <li>Figuring out the layout: I had to design a layout that's reasonable and easy to understand our message. For example, placing the bulb as the "center piece" of the whole layout along with the title of the game.</li>
        <li>Proportions of each elements: The main element that I displayed on all my work is the environment of the game. It contained the bulb and many infrastructures. It was a challenge for me to figure out the right proportions of each element. </li>
        <li>Communication with the whole team: We were 7 members in my team and we all had different schedules, meaning that we had to mainly use a social platform to communicate with each other but not necessarily mean that everyone will check the group chat.</li>
     </p>

     <h3>Solutions</h3>
     <p>
      <li>Getting feedback from my team in person: This solutions solved many confusion and hesitation throughout the whole week because it's given in a direct and a clear understanding on the issue rather than on text.</li>
      <li>Asking teacher's for help: This was a game changer since I didn't have a lot of experience on any of the Adobe softwares. So asking help from a teacher can save a lot of time.  </li>

      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>
         I learned that working in a team requires a lot of patience and that we need to be open-minded. Regarding my role, I had to wait until the halfway point of the week to fully start placing everything to their destinated area. Since, I prepared the potential layout for each poster. As for being open-minded is that not all ideas may be used in the final product ,and that it's best to keep in mind what's best for the team.       </p>
